# pathFinder
This java program was a university assignment. It finds the shortest distance from point A to point B on a given map. Uses array stacks as it's main data structure. The files I completed were ArrayStack.java, EmptyStackException.java, IllegalArgumentException.java, and Path.java. Other files were given to me by the professor.
